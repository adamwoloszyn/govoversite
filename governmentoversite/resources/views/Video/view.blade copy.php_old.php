Carroll County NH Commission 1_30_23 FULL MEETING.mp4

Speaker1: [00:00:01] We will open the meeting of the Board of Commissioners of January 30th, 2023, when everyone join me in the pledge.

Speaker2: [00:00:14] Allegiance to the flag of the United States of.

[00:00:18] America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God.

Speaker2: [00:00:24] Indivisible, with.

Speaker3: [00:00:25] Liberty and justice for all.

Speaker1: [00:00:29] Okay. Well, thank you. And it is 903, and we will go into recess until we have another commissioner present. Coming out of recess. It is 905. So we've already done the pledge. So sorry. That's okay. I just want to get started.

Speaker4: [00:00:57] Parking lot.

Speaker1: [00:00:58] So I don't know if we don't have any media questions.

Speaker2: [00:01:03] I didn't create a zoom for this because it was just a short meeting. A short.

Speaker1: [00:01:06] Meeting. So I do see we have someone from the public, so if you can. Yeah. Two minutes only, because I can't be here for very long. That's fine.

Speaker3: [00:01:19] Greg King from Hopewell. I've read. I've created a petition for you to put the public input at the beginning of the meeting, and I have signatures that I'd like to turn in at this time. I also have others out. The local barber shop has one for signatures, but these are online with 175 signatures.

Speaker2: [00:01:41] Wow. I'd be happy to see.

Speaker3: [00:01:43] You know, we haven't had that.

Speaker4: [00:01:44] Many people talk.

Speaker3: [00:01:45] There's former commissioners on there. There's former delegates on there. Okay.

Speaker4: [00:01:52] I'll just make sure that I think in in the past two years, we've maybe had 4 or 5 people come in and talk. That's not counting you.

Speaker3: [00:02:04] Well, and now if you're going to play the two minutes, it makes it tough for.

Speaker1: [00:02:07] People to talk. Well, we didn't. We? It's always been two minutes.

Speaker3: [00:02:10] You know why That.

Speaker4: [00:02:12] Policy has been in place for a long time.

Speaker3: [00:02:13] But you've never held to it. And, you know, this has been a hot topic and the public and the community is concerned about it.

Speaker4: [00:02:23] When we bring when you bring 30 people in.

Speaker3: [00:02:25] There wasn't 30 people. There wasn't 30 people. There were 15 people and and pretty crowded. And there were 15. Right. And you said you had like 100 people for the new facility. So, you know, I think you need to let people talk. And I think it needs to be at the beginning of the meetings because people have to work. 9:00 is a tough time for people. I left my house this morning at 6:00 to work before I came over here to speak.

Speaker4: [00:02:53] But I appreciate you coming over with us. We can't. You do understand we do have work to get done. Absolutely. We respond. We have worked. It does need to get done. We can't just let 15 people come in and talk as long as they want. It's not feasible. It's not practical. We'll be looking at the policy and figuring out a way to manage it. Maybe registering in advance would be the way to go.

Speaker1: [00:03:20] If there's a big group like that, then that way we could a lot a certain time. Yeah.

Speaker4: [00:03:25] But instead of, you know, it felt kind of like an ambush. All these people suddenly are here. We didn't even know it was coming. So if we know 15 people want to come in and talk, we can put it on the agenda, you know, something like that.

Speaker3: [00:03:37] And, you know, maybe that's something that needs to be done. Yeah. You know, but here's 175 people in less than a week. And at the local barber shop, he has one that people are signing up for. And I haven't even been to other towns in Carroll County. Most of these are Wolfeboro and Tuftonboro because that's where we're our core and where we're out of.

Speaker4: [00:03:59] Most of the towns, I think have their public comment session at the end of their selectmen meetings.

Speaker3: [00:04:05] For our meetings. That's true from an hour to five hours.

Speaker4: [00:04:08] I know. Well, that tells you how much we have to get done for that. We have a lot to get done here.

Speaker3: [00:04:13] Very tough for the public to come in and speak.

Speaker4: [00:04:17] And it makes it tough for us to sit here for five days, you.

Speaker3: [00:04:20] Know, to, you know, basically I don't think in all the conversations that the people have had, you've been tied up more than a half hour at the extreme most. And that meeting that you put in, the two minutes, you showed up 35 minutes late, you know, there's 35 minutes that the public could have spoken. Well, May Excuse me. May I speak?

Speaker2: [00:04:44] I'll let you speak. Go ahead. Go ahead.

Speaker4: [00:04:46] You are the chairperson. You could speak. You could tell me to shut up.

Speaker1: [00:04:51] I'm not telling you to shut up. It's okay. After we took that vote to change it to the end, I really hadn't thought through it. I got a lot of comments about and. And I can understand that, that people have to go to work. They can't sit all day and wait for us for for the non-public at the end. And I went along with it because I was thinking, well, I'm on several committees and we do public comment at the end, but most of those meetings are at night. Correct. So I understand where everyone's coming from and I think we need to discuss it further.

Speaker3: [00:05:32] Yeah, I agree. And I've talked to somebody that's been in here and told me that, you know, they break for lunch and then come back. So some of the meetings could last five hours. Yeah. And so that's inconvenient for the for the Carroll County residents that would like to air, you know, some of their comments. And I really think that it needs to be at the beginning of the meeting so they can come and go. And, you know, Chairman, I'm sure if you're on other committees, you know, people come speak their piece and then they go off. You know, I've seen that with my own selectman meetings in town. And so that's not uncommon.

Speaker1: [00:06:11] Unfortunately, most people are only interested in what they're interested in or not. Yeah.

Speaker3: [00:06:16] But, you know, we do watch it. We do watch the meetings online, which makes it a little bit easier so that when you break or you go in private session, we can go, Yeah, you know, fast forward. You know, I didn't even know this meeting was coming until I saw ad posted it online.

Speaker2: [00:06:35] It was it was a quick decision.

Speaker1: [00:06:36] We didn't know till Friday. Right.

Speaker3: [00:06:39] So. But. Well, thank you very much. Yeah. I'm going to leave.

Speaker4: [00:06:43] Question of these people and I see your name and I see Gary's name. And he was here once. Yeah. How many of these people? Oh, I've never seen any of these people come in and talk to us during a public comment session. Have any of them ever come to a commissioners meeting?

Speaker3: [00:07:00] Even I can't speak for that. Could you find out? I know some of them have told me they've watched the meetings.

Speaker4: [00:07:06] Yeah, but this is about the public comment session. How many have ever come and tried to avail themselves of the opportunities I've been.

Speaker3: [00:07:14] I've owned my property in Wolfeboro for 45 years, and until two months ago, I have never been. I have been watched the meetings and been concerned. But in two months ago, you know, prompted me to come forward.

Speaker4: [00:07:32] And apparently you have a lot of friends who. Absolutely. To come in and.

Speaker3: [00:07:38] We even would.

Speaker4: [00:07:39] Have you ever done as commissioners? This is the first time we've had people interested.

Speaker3: [00:07:44] Well, maybe because they feel it's the wrong decision that this this board has made.

Speaker4: [00:07:53] I'm not going to get into the substance of that. Okay. I just don't feel comfortable doing that in the public session.

Speaker3: [00:07:58] But that's what sparked all this interest.

Speaker4: [00:08:01] It is.

Speaker3: [00:08:02] We need to.

Speaker4: [00:08:03] Do we need to move on.

Speaker3: [00:08:04] You're right. You know, it's in the papers. It's still going to be in the papers for a while because it's not going to go away. It's okay. You know, So, you know, unfortunately, it's it's a decision that was made that affects more than just one person. The ripple effect is huge here.

Speaker2: [00:08:25] We need to thank you.

Speaker3: [00:08:27] I'm going to leave a couple of copies here for some of the delegates because I know they're coming with Seaman and I am going to forward the stuff to them also. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you.

[00:08:38] Appreciate it. Okay. The first thing we.

Speaker1: [00:08:43] Have is we just have to sign this. We've already approved it. It's the.

Speaker5: [00:08:51] Oh.

Speaker2: [00:08:51] Sorry. It's the workplace violence policy.

Speaker1: [00:08:55] Did you pick up your stuff?

Speaker4: [00:08:57] I did not. I figured I would have brought it to me. Okay.

Speaker1: [00:09:00] So we already voted on this, so time to sign it. Yeah, time to sign it.

Speaker2: [00:09:08] Just wanted to.

Speaker1: [00:09:09] Because I don't have much time.

Speaker4: [00:09:10] This is a policy against violence. Yes. Okay. We don't allow if we had much workplace violence here. Well.

Speaker1: [00:09:21] Domain names depends what you consider violence.

Speaker3: [00:09:27] We think it's.

Speaker4: [00:09:29] Good to know. Do we have a pet policy? No. I was a little surprised by the muddy pawprints today.

Speaker2: [00:09:40] Is there any incorrect. Yes. Yes.

Speaker4: [00:09:48] I might start bringing a puppy in. Do you think.

Speaker2: [00:09:52] Your bring pee pads? Okay. Okay, there's that.

Speaker1: [00:09:57] And then the next thing we have to vote on is the union contract for the House of Corrections.

Speaker4: [00:10:04] Do you go through the changes? I didn't pick up my stuff.

Speaker2: [00:10:08] Okay. The. The changes would be I can pull up my copy if you'd like. So the wage scale, which is the appendix on the back on the back has been updated. You can look at mine. Let me see what section.

Speaker1: [00:10:27] I know the paper didn't put my comments in there. They put yours in. Kim's about doing it at the end, but they didn't put mine in there. Well.

Speaker4: [00:10:38] But anyway. Okay, I'd rather not.

Speaker2: [00:10:42] And then on page 28, under Article 27, that wage section has been updated.

Speaker1: [00:10:50] They have signed this, correct?

Speaker2: [00:10:52] They voted on it. They haven't signed it yet, but they voted on it and it passed.

Speaker4: [00:10:56] So our starting salary under this contract is going up immediately, $5.56. And so it'll go from 1744 to $23. And that's a significant increase. And I you know.

Speaker1: [00:11:16] This is the I believe the only other changes was on here. Okay. You said page 28.

Speaker2: [00:11:27] Correct? Page 28, Article 27 Wages. Is that the right page number? Okay. Okay. And then there is just one other. There's the addition of a fitness stipend. Oh, yeah. It's something that we've done in past practice, but now it's actually in the union contract. It's on page 28 also. It should be section 26.9 Physical fitness over here.

Speaker5: [00:11:53] Oh, good.

Speaker2: [00:11:54] I read it this morning.

Speaker4: [00:12:11] So we're giving us the okay, we're giving you $700 stipend to those who pass the physical fitness testing.

Speaker5: [00:12:23] Yeah. I hope they all pass. Yeah.

Speaker1: [00:12:26] Okay. So you just want us to vote to approve this, or do we have you want to sign today, too?

Speaker2: [00:12:32] If you could vote and sign it, that would be great.

Speaker1: [00:12:34] And I know delegation wants.

Speaker2: [00:12:37] It that to the union to sign it as well. Okay.

Speaker4: [00:12:40] So a motion to move that we approve the collective bargaining agreement for the House of Corrections.

Speaker1: [00:12:48] I will second. All those in favor say aye. Hi. Hi.

Speaker4: [00:12:54] So the ayes have it.

Speaker1: [00:12:55] The ayes have it.

Speaker4: [00:12:57] And I'm ready to sign. Is this a signature coffee? Yes. Kim signed this when she's. I know this meeting was called on really short notice, so she couldn't be here. Right.

Speaker1: [00:13:09] But if she can't if she doesn't vote, she can't. Okay. Okay. I was hoping that she might run in just a few minutes.

Speaker4: [00:13:19] She was the negotiator, so I think she'd approve it.

[00:13:22] Oh, yes. So, yeah, this back.

Speaker1: [00:13:36] And then we have some bids. You have to open the jail security so they can go to Shawn.

Speaker4: [00:13:45] We have to pay to get on the courthouse sale. It's been ten days yet.

Speaker2: [00:13:50] And set bids are due by February 1st at 4:00. So Wednesday afternoon.

Speaker4: [00:13:57] If we received any yet. Yes, we have one.

[00:13:59] Okay. Okay. Do you want me to start over? Yeah. Start over. Today's help. I'm surprised. Here. Oh.

Speaker4: [00:14:12] Get my handy pocket knife. Okay.

[00:14:23] No. There's a lot of them. Yeah.

Speaker5: [00:14:46] Okay.

Speaker4: [00:14:48] Let's just document that we received him. There's one from Minuteman Security. Yep. Life and security. And life safety.

[00:15:02] And it looks well, I can't tell you if it's complete.

Speaker1: [00:15:07] Well, this is just so we can hand them over to Sean.

Speaker4: [00:15:09] Let's just go to bid.

[00:15:11] Because I don't know that we can. I'm looking for a price on this one. I don't think I. Okay.

Speaker4: [00:15:26] It looks like the total on this one was 34,000 plus 665,515.

[00:15:34] So. There's a subtotal.

Speaker1: [00:15:41] This doesn't have a total. This has a yearly lease.

[00:15:44] A yearly. Okay.

Speaker1: [00:15:48] I have one from Howard Systems. 16, Quarry Drive, Rochester, New Hampshire. And. Your service contract, as proposed above, is $18,240 yearly.

[00:16:11] I don't really.

Speaker4: [00:16:12] So I have one from Johnson Controls. It's it has multiple sections, so it's hard to there's some recurring monthly costs over five years. There's some initial costs, there's some labor costs and maintenance costs. So. So each one of these has some cost involved.

[00:16:51] Looks good to me. This one's easier to read. Okay. This one is from one source security.

Speaker1: [00:17:03] And I believe they are in Merrimack, New Hampshire. They have the project cost is $732,555.30. And then the annual maintenance is $22,310 per year.

[00:17:25] Okay. As you saw when it was received. Yeah. Thank you.

Speaker5: [00:17:32] What does it do, Melissa? The 25th.

Speaker2: [00:17:35] It was to the 25th. Yes. These were received.

Speaker4: [00:17:37] On the 24th and the 25th. And this one on the 24th. This one is from Sigma. And again, this is a long package. There are the details. It's the cost breakdown. Hey again, this is in multiple pieces, so it's hard to come up with. His recurring costs. Base proposal 219,000. And there's some alternate security. 10,017 thousand. Of course, it depends which one's proposing. Right.

Speaker1: [00:19:12] For this.

[00:19:12] Week, he's going to have to go through these this job. I know these are all kind of over the place and.

Speaker5: [00:19:18] He'll probably work with Bob.

[00:19:19] On that. I have one from Insecurity from Bow, New Hampshire. I mean, just for the general public.

Speaker1: [00:19:30] This is for an upgrade of the Department of Corrections Integrated security system. And they have Labor $100,820 software and equipment, $324,355. Total investment $425,174. So they're kind of all over the place.

Speaker5: [00:19:55] Yes, but that's okay because they're all different. We'll take the one that we need.

Speaker1: [00:20:00] These will go to the superintendent.

[00:20:08] We have another member of the public here.

Speaker6: [00:20:10] We do.

Speaker1: [00:20:12] Melissa, do we have anything else?

Speaker4: [00:20:13] Representative Villani is joining us.

Speaker2: [00:20:15] Anything else? Okay.

Speaker7: [00:20:17] Do you want me to sit up there with you guys?

Speaker1: [00:20:20] Sure.

Speaker4: [00:20:20] It would be a pleasure for us.

Speaker1: [00:20:23] Matthew, do you have anything?

Speaker5: [00:20:24] No. For our meeting. Any public comment? No, nothing. I got nothing.

Speaker1: [00:20:30] We will adjourn. It is 924.

Speaker5: [00:20:32] Thank you. Good to see you. Are you.

Speaker4: [00:20:34] Reassessing or.

Speaker5: [00:20:36] Reassessing? Assessing. Sorry.

Speaker1: [00:20:38] I should have said reassessing. Yeah, that's probably the.
